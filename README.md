# mp3slider-Matlab
Matlab function that slides mp3 into x number of .wav with the length that you want (in seconds)

It's a function that I use to make datasets

Example:

#Call function
mp3slider(name,duration,fs_output)

name:number of next audiofile
duration: duration of each created audiofiles
fs_output: sampling frecuency of each created audiofiles
